# customer_segmentation
This repository contains scripts related to customer segmentation. Available models include 
- kmeans
- kmedoids
- agglomerative clustering, and 
- gaussian mixture models

Preprocessing functions such as 
- standard and mix-max scaling 
- removing multi-collinearity
- linear dimensionality reduction using PCA/SVD 
- nonlinear dimensionality reduction using autoencoder
- outlier detection (base model : isolation forest)

are also included in the preprocessing module.
